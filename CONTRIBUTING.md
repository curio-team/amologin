## ‚ú® Testing a client application

The client application must use the latest version of [sdclient](https://github.com/curio-team/sdclient). Afterwards add this to the `.env` of the client application:

```env
SD_DEV_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

Start this sdlogin project with:
    
```bash
php artisan serve --port=8080
```

The client application can now login to the local sdlogin server.
